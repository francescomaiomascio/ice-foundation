# Boundary: Foundation → Consciousness

## Purpose

Define the boundary between the **ICE Foundation** and the **ICE Consciousness** domain.

This document establishes what the Foundation **constrains** with respect to
long-term memory, decision continuity, and historical reasoning, and what it
explicitly does **not** define, store, operate, or interpret.

The goal is to prevent **conceptual authority** from collapsing into
memory systems, learning processes, or historical interpretation layers.

---

## Role of the Foundation

The ICE Foundation:

- Defines **axioms** and **structural invariants**
- Constrains what *may* be remembered, attributed, and reasoned about
- Establishes requirements for **traceability**, **authority**, and **determinism**
- Defines the **validity conditions** under which historical reasoning is admissible

The Foundation defines **truth conditions**, not historical content.

The Foundation does **not** remember.

---

## Role of Consciousness

ICE Consciousness:

- Maintains **long-term memory** and historical continuity
- Preserves decision context across time
- Supports retrospective reasoning and causal reconstruction
- Aggregates traces into durable cognitive structures
- Enables explanation of *how and why a system reached its current state*

Consciousness answers **why things happened over time**,  
never **what is true by definition**.

---

## Explicit Non-Responsibilities of the Foundation

The Foundation does **NOT** define:

- Memory storage models or representations
- Retention policies, decay, or forgetting strategies
- Knowledge graph schemas or embeddings
- Temporal abstraction or summarization mechanisms
- Historical compression or pattern extraction logic
- Learning rules derived from past behavior

All such concerns belong **exclusively** to the Consciousness domain.

---

## Constraint Relationship

- The Foundation constrains **what must remain traceable and valid**
- Consciousness preserves, aggregates, and reasons over traces
- Consciousness may summarize or abstract history
- Consciousness may **not** alter axioms, invariants, or authority

If historical reasoning contradicts axioms or invariants,
the reasoning is invalid — not the Foundation.

---

## Invalid Boundary Violations

The following constitute boundary violations:

- Treating memory or experience as authority
- Allowing historical patterns to redefine axioms or invariants
- Encoding learning outcomes as foundational truth
- Using Consciousness to justify invariant violations
- Allowing long-term memory to override explicit authority

Such actions break ICE compliance.

---

## Canonical Status

This boundary is **authoritative**.

Any Consciousness subsystem claiming ICE compliance
must demonstrate that long-term memory and historical reasoning
operate strictly within the constraints defined here.

The Foundation constrains Consciousness.  
Consciousness never redefines the Foundation.
