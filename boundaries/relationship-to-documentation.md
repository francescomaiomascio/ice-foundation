# Boundary: Foundation ↔ Documentation

## Purpose

Define and stabilize the **conceptual boundary** between the **ICE Foundation**
and **Documentation**.

This document establishes that documentation is **explanatory and descriptive**,
not authoritative, and must never redefine, extend, or reinterpret
axioms, structural invariants, or canonical boundaries.

The goal is to separate **epistemic authority** from **explanatory clarity**.

---

## Foundational Position

The ICE Foundation is the **sole source of canonical truth**.

Documentation exists to:
- explain
- contextualize
- illustrate
- teach
- summarize

Documentation does **not** define validity.

---

## Role of the Foundation

The ICE Foundation:

- Defines axioms that establish what is true
- Defines structural invariants that must never be violated
- Defines canonical boundaries between domains
- Establishes non-negotiable conceptual constraints

The Foundation is **normative**.

---

## Role of Documentation

ICE Documentation:

- Explains Foundation concepts
- Describes rationale, motivation, and implications
- Provides onboarding, guidance, and examples
- Helps humans understand the system

Documentation is **descriptive**, not normative.

Documentation answers **what this means**,  
never **what is true by definition**.

---

## Explicit Non-Responsibilities of the Foundation

The ICE Foundation does NOT define:

- Tutorials or walkthroughs
- Examples or use cases
- Developer guides or manuals
- Explanatory diagrams or narratives
- Pedagogical structure or learning paths
- Commentary, interpretation, or opinion

All such material belongs exclusively to Documentation.

---

## Constraint Relationship

- The Foundation defines **truth and validity**
- Documentation explains and reflects that truth
- Documentation may be incomplete or outdated
- The Foundation remains authoritative regardless

If documentation conflicts with axioms or invariants,
the documentation is wrong — not the Foundation.

---

## Boundary Violations

The following constitute **boundary violations**:

- Treating documentation as a source of truth
- Using documentation to justify invariant changes
- Allowing explanatory text to override axioms
- Encoding canonical rules only in documentation
- Inferring authority from clarity or completeness

Such actions invalidate conceptual integrity.

---

## Canonical Status

This boundary definition is **canonical and authoritative**.

Any documentation claiming ICE compliance
must demonstrate that it faithfully reflects
Foundation truth without redefining it.

The Foundation defines truth.  
Documentation explains it.
