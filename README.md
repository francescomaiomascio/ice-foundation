# ICE Foundation  
## Axiomatic Authority of the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Foundation defines the **axiomatic and invariant layer** of the ICE ecosystem.

It establishes the **non-negotiable truths** under which any ICE-compliant system
is allowed to exist, execute, and evolve over time.

ICE Foundation does not describe systems.  
It defines the **conditions of validity** for systems.

Everything built in ICE — runtimes, engines, intelligence layers,
interfaces, and orchestration — is constrained by what is defined here.

---

## What ICE Foundation Is

ICE Foundation is:

- an **axiomatic system**
- a **conceptual authority**
- a **structural constraint layer**
- the **root of epistemic legitimacy** in ICE

It answers a single class of questions:

> What must always be true for intelligent systems  
> to remain governable, inspectable, and meaningful over time?

---

## What ICE Foundation Is Not

ICE Foundation is **not**:

- a runtime
- an engine
- an architecture
- a framework
- an API
- a specification of behavior
- a description of implementation

It contains **no executable code by design**.

---

## Scope of Authority

ICE Foundation defines:

- **Axioms**  
  Foundational assumptions that are taken as true and never negotiated.

- **Structural Invariants**  
  Properties that must never be violated by any ICE system.

- **Conceptual Boundaries**  
  Explicit limits of Foundation authority and downstream responsibility.

ICE Foundation defines **what is valid**,  
not **how validity is enforced**.

---

## Position in the ICE Ecosystem

Authority flows in one direction only:

**Foundation → Runtime → Engine → Intelligence → Interfaces**

- Runtimes enforce axioms and invariants
- Engines operate within invariant constraints
- Intelligence proposes intent but holds no authority
- Interfaces expose behavior without redefining meaning

No downstream domain may reinterpret, extend,
or weaken the Foundation by implication.

## Nature of This Repository

This repository is **normative**.

All content here is authoritative with respect to:

- epistemic truth
- system legitimacy
- invariant compliance

If any documentation, implementation, or system behavior
contradicts this repository, **it is incorrect by definition**.

---

## Canonical Status

ICE Foundation is the **root authority** of the ICE ecosystem.

Compliance with ICE is impossible without compliance with this repository.

This is not a design choice.  
It is a structural requirement.

---

## Notes

ICE Foundation does not evolve quickly.

Change here is rare, deliberate, and system-wide in impact.

This is intentional.

Stability at the foundation  
is what allows intelligence, systems, and products to evolve safely.
