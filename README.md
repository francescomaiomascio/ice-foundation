# ICE Foundation
## Axiomatic Authority of the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Foundation defines the **axiomatic and invariant layer** of ICE.

It establishes the **non-negotiable conditions** under which any ICE-based system
is allowed to exist, execute, adapt, or evolve.

ICE Foundation does not describe systems.  
It defines **when systems are valid**.

Everything built in ICE — runtimes, engines, intelligence layers,
interfaces, orchestration, products —
**operates under the constraints defined here**.

If something violates this layer, it is not “experimental”.  
It is **wrong by definition**.

---

## What ICE Foundation Is

ICE Foundation is:

- an **axiomatic system**
- a **source of structural truth**
- a **hard constraint layer**
- the **root of legitimacy** in ICE

It answers one question only:

> What must *always* be true  
> for intelligent systems to remain governable, inspectable,  
> and meaningful over time?

If you are not asking this question,  
you do not need ICE.

## What ICE Foundation Is Not

ICE Foundation is **not**:

- a runtime
- an engine
- a framework
- an API
- a reference implementation
- a specification of behavior
- a set of best practices

It contains **no executable code by design**.

Execution without axioms scales chaos.
ICE refuses that premise.

---

## Scope of Authority

ICE Foundation defines:

- **Axioms**  
  Truths that are assumed, not negotiated.

- **Structural Invariants**  
  Properties that must never be violated.

- **Conceptual Boundaries**  
  Explicit limits of responsibility between domains.

ICE Foundation defines **what is allowed to be true**,  
not how truth is enforced.

---

## Position in the ICE Ecosystem

Authority flows in one direction only:

**Foundation → Runtime → Engine → Intelligence → Interfaces**

- Runtime enforces invariants
- Engines operate inside constraints
- Intelligence proposes intent without authority
- Interfaces expose behavior without redefining meaning

No downstream layer may reinterpret this hierarchy.

---

## Canonical Status

This repository is **normative**.

If documentation, implementation, or behavior
contradicts ICE Foundation,
**the contradiction is an error**.

ICE compliance starts here.
There is no shortcut.

---

## Notes

ICE Foundation evolves slowly.

That is not conservatism.  
It is how you prevent intelligent systems from rotting.
